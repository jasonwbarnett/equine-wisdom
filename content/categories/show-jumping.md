🚀 Show Jumping
Master the technical and athletic skills needed to jump courses successfully and compete at your desired level.
## Fundamentals of Show Jumping
Show jumping is a discipline that tests both horse and rider's technical ability, courage, and partnership. It combines the precision of dressage with the athleticism required to cleanly jump obstacles of varying heights and complexity.
## The Jumping Position
#### Two-Point Position
The foundation of jumping. The rider's seat is slightly out of the saddle with upper body angled forward. Legs remain stable and underneath the rider.
#### Approach Phase
Maintain steady pace and rhythm. Upper body remains nearly upright. Hands maintain consistent contact with the horse's mouth.
#### Takeoff Phase
As the horse leaves the ground, rotate hips forward and fold at the waist. Close the angle between rider and horse to maintain balance.
#### Peak of Jump
Upper body is parallel with the horse's back. Rider's seat is out of the saddle. Eyes look to the next fence.
#### Landing Phase
Maintain the jumping position as the horse lands. Gradually straighten upper body. Immediately prepare for next approach.
## Types of Jumps
✓ Vertical
Rails stacked vertically. Requires precision and bascule
✓ Oxer
Two verticals set close together. Teaches scope and power
✓ Liverpool
Jump with water beneath or beside it. Tests bravery
✓ Bank
Elevated platform jump. Requires different approach
## Training Progression
1
#### Flatwork Foundation
Perfect your basic gaits, transitions, and jumping position on flat ground before introducing jumps.
2
#### Cavaletti Work
Start with poles on the ground to establish rhythm and jumping position. Gradually raise them.
3
#### Small Fences
Begin with low jumps (18-24 inches) to develop confidence and technique. Keep sessions positive.
4
#### Combination Jumps
Practice navigating related distances and combinations. Develop eye for distances.
5

## Common Jumping Mistakes
❌ Looking Down

Don't "jump ahead" of your horse. Stay with the motion
❌ Rushing Approaches
Keep steady pace. Rushing leads to poor distances
