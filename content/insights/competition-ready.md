🏆 Competition Ready
Prepare yourself and your horse for competition success with proven strategies for peak performance and show day excellence.
## From Training to Competition
Competition requires more than just riding skills—it demands physical conditioning, mental preparation, logistical planning, and tactical strategy. Champions aren't born; they're built through systematic preparation. This comprehensive guide covers every aspect of getting horse and rider competition-ready for peak performance on show day.
## 8-Week Competition Preparation Plan
📅
#### Weeks 1-2: Baseline Assessment
Evaluate current fitness and skill level. Identify weaknesses and areas needing improvement. Begin baseline conditioning.
📅
#### Weeks 3-4: Building Foundation
Increase training frequency and intensity. Focus on fundamentals and weaknesses identified in weeks 1-2. 5 days per week training.
📅
#### Weeks 5-6: Skill Development
Practice competition movements and patterns. Include practice competitions or simulated events. Work on fitness peaks.
📅
#### Week 7: Taper Week
Reduce training volume by 30-40%. Maintain intensity but decrease repetitions. Allow recovery and muscle adaptation.
📅
#### Week 8: Show Week
Light conditioning only. Focus on mental preparation, equipment check, and logistics. Get plenty of rest.

## In-Competition Tactics

Know your ideal pace. Start controlled and build momentum rather than sprinting early.
💭 Focus Forward
Don't look back at mistakes. Focus on the next movement or obstacle ahead.
